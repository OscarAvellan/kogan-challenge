# kogan-challenge
 Find the average cubic weight for all products in the "Air Conditioners" category.

 To check if it is installed, run the following command

 ```
 ruby -v
 ```

To check how to install Ruby in other operating systems go to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

### Running script

```
ruby path/to/kogan-challenge/kogan_coding_challenge.rb
